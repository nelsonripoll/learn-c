## Preprocessor Directive
The **C Preprocessor** is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in 
 the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text 
 substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing 
 before the actual compilation. We'll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.

All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol. It must be the first 
 nonblank character, and for readability, a preprocessor directive should begin 
 in the first column.
